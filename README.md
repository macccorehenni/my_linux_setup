# Linux Setup
This is the repository I use to setup my Linux Chromebook via *Google Chrostini*. 
## Programs included
* VIT— a task manager I use (dep: taskwarrior, its underbelly; pip, to install)
* Gnome Shell Pomodoro- A timer I use
* VS Code— My text editor– in DEB form
* qutebrowser— Easy to use, vim-like browser
And more, as more updates come.
## Note on architecture
These files were collected on a Chromebook using the aarch64 architecture.
